Description of Game

StanleyMUD is the first game that I am coding with the idea of someone else eventually playing it. I'm planning a pretty robust set of features, and I am excited to see how much I can extend this idea outwards. If you have ideas for features and such, please drop me a line and let me know what you're thinking.

Current Map should be: 
    [RedKeyRoom]   [Vault]   [BlueKeyRoom]
        ||           ||         || 
     [LHall]  =  [MHall]  =  [RHall]
                   ||
                 [Entry]

 In RedKeyRoom there is a Red Key.
 In BlueKeyRoom there is a Blue Key.
 In MHall there is a North-facing door. It needs both red and blue keys to open.
 In Vault is the Treasure.
